Wii Nunchuck to USB Keyboard implementation

You'll need:
- A Wii Nunchuck
- A v1 Minimus
- An Adafruit nunchuck breakout

This implementation converts left/right/up/down on the joystick to a/d/w/s
and the two buttons to Shift and Ctrl.
Currently the accelerometer is ignored.

Get LUFA from http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php and configure it's
location in the makefile.

Ensure minimus is ready to be programmed (while holding HWB, press Reset)
Then to build and upload, just run "make"

Minimus pin out (from https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Arduino_IDE_with_Minimus#Minimus_to_Arduino_Pin_Out):

Connect VCC to + on the Nunchuck breakout and GND to - 
PB2 to Clock (c on the breakout), and PB3 to Data (d).

If either the blue or red LEDs on the Minimus stay on, then something is wrong.
